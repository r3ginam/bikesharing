# Bike Sharing
## Overview

This project shows stakeholders an analysis of bike trip data from New York City. Stakeholders would like to see this analysis to inform their decision to invest in a similar bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. 

**Tools and Resources:**

* [CitiBike Trip Data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html)

* [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/views/bikesharing_16180786759800/BikeSharingStory?:language=en&:display_count=y&publish=yes&:origin=viz_share_link)

* Python with Pandas (version 3.8.3)

## Results

The following shows the breakdown between usertypes: subscribers and customers. According to this pie chart, about *80%* of users subscribers. From this, we can infer that many people are using bikes on an ongoing basis, and these subscribers are [paying about $15 per month](https://www.citibikenyc.com/pricing) to use the bikes.

According to the visualization below, the vast majority of bikers ride for less than *15 minutes.* This means that a bike could be shared about four times per hour.

The map below shows that in New York, some bike stations should be larger than others to accommodate more bikes, specifically in central NYC. The same could be true of Des Moines, Iowa's downtown areas.

The visual below shows that 8 am and 5 to 6 pm are popular times to rent bikes on most weekdays. 5-6 pm on Wednesdays are not as popular as the other weekday afternoons for bike rentals. Saturdays and Sundays have a steady stream of rentals from about 10 am to 6 pm.
